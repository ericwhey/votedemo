This is the project from the Blockchain Hackathon on June 22-24, 2018.

It is of course a little hacky.

To get it running you'll need to do the following:

- Install composer and update the composer files in ./composer
- Install npm and install the following packages

npm install hash.js
npm install elliptic
npm install -g bower
npm install -g browserify

- With browserify installed, execute the following command:

browserify main.js -o wwwroot/bundle.js

- With bower installed, install the following:

bower install chart.js
bower install angular
bower install angular-websocket
