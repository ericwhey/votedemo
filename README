This is the project from the Blockchain Hackathon on June 22-24, 2018.

It is of course a little hacky.

To get it running you'll need to do the following:

- Install composer and update the composer files in ./composer
- Install npm and install the following packages

npm install hash.js
npm install elliptic
npm install -g bower
npm install -g browserify

- With browserify installed, execute the following command:

browserify main.js -o wwwroot/bundle.js

(Note that .gitignore is set to ingore wwwroot/bundle.js since we generate it here)

- With bower installed, install the following:

bower install chart.js
bower install angular
bower install angular-websocket
bower install kazuhikoarase/qrcode-generator

- Configure your web server to use index_router.php for incoming requests

RewriteEngine On

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f
RewriteRule ^ - [L]

RewriteRule ^ index_router.php [L]

- You'll need to create world writable directories in:

smarty/compile
smarty/cache

- Point your browser at the following url (which is referencing a Smart-Object at cotr/vote):

http://localhost/votes/cotr/vote

Notes

- There is no storage except on the blockchain
- AngularJS is here for future capabilities, and could be removed with a bit of refactoring
- Could easily be extended to store vote info, mostly just addresses to SmartObjects, in MongoDB
